## Lit and Web Components highlights

The product is made from small, reusable Web Components. Each part keeps its own design and can also work inside React, Vue, Angular, or a normal web page. Automated checks cover the most important actions.

## Java backend highlights

The Java backend uses Spring Boot. It provides real API endpoints to list, search, and create publishing task records. It checks incoming information, returns clear errors, exposes a health check, and includes automated Java tests.

## Architecture and state flow

The browser application calls the Java API on port 8080. The Java service checks the request and keeps the shared product information. After a user creates a record, the API returns the saved result and the browser refreshes the list.

## Accessibility and responsive behaviour

Buttons, forms, and links can be used with a keyboard. Labels explain what each field does, and important information is shown with words, not only colours. The layout also adjusts for tablets and phones.
